# Multi Persistant History Stopwatches

- i made this so i can manually track how much screen time i do lol
- you could use it to track your commute time

Instead of laps, the timer saves a history every time you reset it (you can delete an entry if you make one by accident)

it then shows statistics such as average time and total time of your past timers, and when they were added. may add more detailed statistic views such as weekly trend. 

perfect for measuring how long an event or activity lasts!

syncs easily, and doesn't get lost or inaccurate if you close and reopen the page! (stopwatch is calculated using differences between times since the epoch of now and when you started the timer)
