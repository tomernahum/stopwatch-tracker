- make it build (probably just disabling ssr) + deploy

- make timer history & statistics work

- test on safari

- timer ordering


- syncing timers using a tinybase sync adapter
    - use yjs to try to learn a little yjs

- timer drag and drop

- analytics and publish


Random idea:
add a todo note option as well to add along side stopwatches
