- timer ordering / - timer drag and drop


- syncing timers using a tinybase sync adapter

- analytics and publish



Random idea:
add a todo note option as well to add along side stopwatches

Random idea:
- colors on history items then display total and average for each color and total for all colors

- Change "Reset" to "Clear"
